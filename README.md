# Individual Project
#### Title: Bullseye Bonanza
##### Description: Just like its name suggests, this game tests the user's ability to hit a target. Players are welcomed on the start screen and provided with a button to start. The game has multiple levels and a difficulty system. The game ends when the user beats all levels or when the timer runs out. At the end screen, the user is given a score based on how many targets they successfully hit.
